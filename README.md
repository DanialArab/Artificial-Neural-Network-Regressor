# Artificial Neural Network Regressor to Predict Rate of Penetration during Oil Well Drilling Operation

In this project, artificial neural networks were used to predict rate of penetration, also called drill rate (DR), during an oil well drilling operation. The Volve datasets, published by Equinor in 2018 (on a license of Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0), were used to build the deep learning model. This data set was preprocessed by Tunkiel et al. (Tunkiel et al., 2020). The  datasets  even wells containing 12 commonly logged attributes of:

* Measured Depth 
* Weight on Bit
* Average Standpipe Pressure
* Average Surface Torque
* Rate of Penetration
* Average Rotary Speed
* Mud Flow
* Mud Density
* Diameter
* Average Hookload
* Hole Depth (TVD) 
* University of Stavanger Rate of Penetration (USROP) Gamma

Previously, DR were also calculated through traditional machine learning (ML) approaches such as Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and KNeighbors
